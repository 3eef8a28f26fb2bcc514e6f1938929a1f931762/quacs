# QuACS Philosophy

- Course Scheduling is not that complex and can be done in the user's browser.  QuACS will always be a simple static website on GitHub pages.
- QuACS should be accessible to everyone. If you have an accessibility issue, please let us know and we will try our best to fix it.
- Mobile phones should not be second class citizens. Do not hide important data from people on mobile devices.
- Open Source. Everything in QuACS is open source under the MIT License.
- Competition drives innovation. We love competition because we feel that everyone is better off because of it. Our data is not only publicly stored in this repo, but it also is easy to acquire yourself using our scrapers. We would love to see what people can do with the data!
- Your privacy is extremely important. We do not track website visits and, because everything is client side, you can rest assured that nothing you upload or do on QuACS is viewable by anyone else.

# Other Notes

While QuACS and the developers are huge fans of [RCOS](https://rcos.io/), we are not affiliated with RCOS at this time. If you want to help out with development, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/EyGZTAP).

We are also not affiliated with YACS. The work they have done has been invaluable to the RPI student body and while our codebase is different, much of our design was inspired by YACS. We however also support competition and believe we provide a number of features that YACS does not. We are hoping you try us out when you register for classes next semester.
