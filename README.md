# QuACS Philosophy

- Course Scheduling is not that complex, do not over complicate it with a server. QuACS will always be simply hosted using GitHub pages.
- QuACS should be accessible to everyone. If you have an accessibility issue please let us know we will try our best to fix it.
- Get the data from the source. We always try and get the most accurate data even if that involves scraping the data yourself
- Mobile phones should not be second class citizens. Do not hide important data from people on mobile devices.
- Open Source. Everything in QuACS is open source under the MIT License.
- Competition drives innovation. We love competition because we feel that everyone is better off because of it. Our data is not only publicly stored in this repo, but it also is easy to acquire yourself using our scrapers. We would love to see what people can do with the data!
- Your privacy is extremely important. We do not track website visits and because everything is client side, you can rest assured that nothing you upload or do on QuACS is viewable by anyone else
- Spelling is overrated. There are sure to be spelling mistakes in QuACS and its related files. Spelling is hard and overrated, feel free to make a PR to fix them though.


# Other Notes

While QuACS and the developers are huge fans of [RCOS](https://rcos.io/), we are not affiliated with RCOS at this time. If you want to help out with development, join our [discord](https://discord.gg/EyGZTAP).

We are also not affiliated with YACS. The work they have done over the years has been invaluable to the RPI student body and while our codebase is different, much of our design was inspired by YACS. We however also support competition and believe we provide a number of features that YACS does not. We are hoping you try us out when you register for classes next semester.
