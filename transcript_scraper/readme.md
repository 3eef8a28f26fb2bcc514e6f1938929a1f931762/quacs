## How to use the demo

1. Go to sis.rpi.edu
2. Go to your transcript
3. Press ctrl+s to save the page as html
4. Open the index.html file in your browser
5. Upload the transcript html file
6. Results will be printed to the console


## Notes
- index.html is just a demo file for test and for actual use in quacs you should just import the scrape_transcript.js file and call the `scrape_transcript()` function
- This was only tested with my personal transcript (for some reason nobody wants to just hand over their transcript to me). It is very likely other transcripts will cause issues that will need to be fixed. Especially transcripts for students who are not undergrads.
